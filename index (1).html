        <h2>Crop yield, in agriculture, refers to the amount of usable product (like grains, fruits, or vegetables) harvested per unit of land area.</h2>
        <p>
            Farming is very important for food and the economy, especially in a country like India. To grow more crops, it is important to understand what factors help improve crop production. This study focuses on finding out how different things like soil, weather, water, and fertilizer affect the amount of crops produced.

        <h1>Abstract</h1>
        <p>
            Farming is very important for food and the economy, especially in a country like India. To grow more crops, it is important to understand what factors help improve crop production. This study focuses on finding out how different things like soil, weather, water, and fertilizer affect the amount of crops produced.
            The main goal is to study how different conditions such as region (North, South, East, West), soil type (Clay, Sandy, Loam, etc.), crop type (Wheat, Rice, Maize, etc.), rainfall (in mm), temperature (in Celsius), days taken to harvest, and the use of fertilizer and irrigation affect crop yield (measured in tons per hectare).
            The dataset also includes the type of weather (Sunny, Rainy, or Cloudy) during the growing season.
            We used basic data analysis and graphs to understand the data. The results show that crops grow better in loamy and clay soils, especially when enough water and fertilizer are used. Good weather and proper care also help crops grow more. For example, rice needs more water, while crops like wheat need the right temperature.
            The study found that the highest crop yield was achieved when loamy soil, proper irrigation, and fertilizer were used, with sunny weather and average rainfall. Among all crops, rice and maize gave the best yield under these conditions. This proves that choosing the right combination of soil, water, and crop can help farmers get better results.
            This study helps support smart farming decisions and better food production.
